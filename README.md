This UI looks so cute, and I'm pretty sure my Flutter skills can't take this completely. 

## 🦄 Results

I'm aware of the couple of mistakes in the results. But, I'm kinda learning Flutter and ignoring those mistakes for now.
As always, we have two Screens, Home and Details page! The code for each screens can be found in the `screes/` directory.
